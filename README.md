# Broadcast Distributed Voting Algorithm in Population Protocols

This implementation is for majority voting in DMVR(Pairwise), B-DMV, B-DMV1, and B-DMV2 versions.
In the network_generator.py code, the adjency matrix of your network is created. 
The main.py file should be run and you need to follow below steps for specifying details of your running: 

1- Choose your network graph topology

2- Choose the version of algorithms you need to be run

3- Enter number of agents

4- Enter percentage of nodes in majority (for example 53 for 53%)

The final output of total, first phase, and second phase runtime will be in Opr0, Opr1, and Opr2 respectively.

The final output of total, first phase, and second phase number of messageswill be in Msg0, Msg1, and Msg2 respectively.
